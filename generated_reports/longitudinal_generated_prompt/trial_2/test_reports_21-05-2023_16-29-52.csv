"Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Widening of the mediastinal contour may be due to low lung volumes and supine AP technique. Diffuse hazy opacities are noted throughout the lungs, most pronounced in the left lung base. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures and probable mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are noted. No pneumothorax is identified.

"Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement. The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is bibasilar atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.",Hyperinflated lungs with bibasilar atelectasis.,51791247
Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Marked degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are partially imaged.,Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.,55803590

"Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The aorta remains tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top normal.","Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.",57464511

"AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained five hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, the patient has been intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. No pneumothorax has developed.",Appropriate position of ETT.,56220925
"AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.",No acute intrathoracic process.,59285132
"Single portable view of the chest. When compared to prior, there has been no significant interval change. Again seen are diffusely increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs with a more focal regions of consolidation at the right lung base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Degenerative changes again noted at the shoulders.",No significant interval change. Increased interstitial markings in the lungs with more focal regions of consolidation at the right lung base which could represent either pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. Consider PA and lateral views to further characterize.,50848970
There is a new large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Diffuse coarse reticular opacities are seen throughout both lungs with more confluent consolidation at the right base. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.,"Large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Diffuse coarse reticular opacities with more confluent consolidation at the right base which could represent asymmetric edema although superimposed infection is also possible.",57664750
AP portable supine view of the chest. There has been interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube residing 3.2 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen. Gas-filled loops of bowel in the left upper abdomen noted. Gas-filled loops of bowel in the left upper quadrant raise potential concern for small bowel obstruction. No definite signs of free air below the right hemidiaphragm. There is subtle ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung likely representing atelectasis. No supine evidence for large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No acute bony abnormalities.,ET and NG tubes positioned appropriately. Subtle ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung likely atelectasis. Please refer to subsequent CT chest for further details.,56042355
