"Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms, suggestive of COPD. No focal pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The osseous structures are unremarkable. No radiopaque foreign body.",1. No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process. 2. COPD.,3272470c-530109a6-4ffe7fca-c776dbb3-224eda66,51777681
